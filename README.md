# Psychic-Game

This is a Psychic guessing game in which the user will have up to 9 guesses to guess a random number chosen by the computer.

The user will be prompted to enter their name, and then they will be introdued to the game in several alert messages.

The user will then need to guess the computer's letter or else they lose.

The "number_game_unrelated" is a different kind of game I was experimenting with (not finished) during this time. It is not relavent to the assignment at hand, but I kept it in the folder due to its small relavence.

I have not yet, but plan to spend more time with specific markdown documentation for future read me files.
